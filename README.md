# AmazonSimulator
AmazonSimulator created to simulate robots moving in an Amazon Warehouse.
This simulation makes use of the following systems to create a successful simulation:
- Three.JS and JavaScript as Client.
- C# as Server.

The Simulator is made so that multiple clients can access the server to show the simulation.
